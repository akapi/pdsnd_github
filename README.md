This project contains the source files for analyzing the data
of bikesharing usage in following cities:

It is an interactive program, which you can run via commandline
`python bikeshare.py`

**Prerequisite**
Python 3.x must be installed on your machine and contain 
following third party packages:
- pandas

**How to extend to other cities?**
If you want to add more cities you can extend 
the Python dictionary `CITY_DATA` within 
the file `bikeshare.py`.

**Limiation**
Currently the filtering by month is possible only for the months
'january', 'february', 'march', 'april', 'may', 'june'.

### Files used
For each supported city a corresponding CSV file is needed. E.g. _chicago.csv_ for _Chicago_
Currently following files are required:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Credits
This project is created based on the [Udacity](https://learn.udacity.com/) nanodegree _Programming for Data Science with Python_.
